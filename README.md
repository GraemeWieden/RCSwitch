RCSwitch
========

Extensions to the Arduino RCSwitch library for additional protocols

This version of RCSwitch increases supported packet size from 32 bit to 64 bit.

New Protocols
-------------
Protocol 4 to support Kambrook remote power sockets. These use a different protocol to the three currently supported.
They also have a 47 bit packet size necessitating the increase from 32 to 64 bit.
